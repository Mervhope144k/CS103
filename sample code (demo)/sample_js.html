<h3 align="center">Sample JavaScript code</h3>

<p>If the scripts below do not give you a pop-up window, then you may need to turn off your Pop-up Blocker. Note: After the script runs, click the Back button to get back to this page.</p> 

<p>For each script, take a look at the source code and compare it to what is happening.</p>


<p><a href="add2nums_fcn.html">#1 Sample JavaScript program</a> - 
runs a program where the user is prompted to enter 2 numbers. They are added and 
the result is displayed to the page.</p>

<p><a href="tutorial19112.html">#2 Sample JavaScript program</a> -
runs a program (script) that randomly generates 2 numbers. There will be a total 
of 8 pop-up windows. The first number is a quantity and the second number is its unit price. The total cost is then calculated. The total cost appears twice. The first time it is rounded using the Math.round() function and the second time it is rounded using the .toFixed(n) method).  The random numbers are generated with JavaScript function Math.random().

<p>[<b>FootNote</b> to #1 above:  If #1 script does not work, try enabling a script option<br /> in your Tools > Internet Options of IE7:<br />
--Go to Tools > Internet Options (Security Tab)<br />
--Click on the button called "Custom level..."<br />
--Scroll down to the category "Scripting", and ENABLE: "Allow website to prompt for info using scripted windows."<br />
--REMEMBER what you did so that you can un-ENABLE later as desired.]
