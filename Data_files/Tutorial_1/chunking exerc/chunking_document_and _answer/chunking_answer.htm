<h2 id="rat">Rationale for LOGIC:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>To enable you to (1)communicate effectively with convincing arguments, and (2) develop patterns of reasoning that will help in decision making.</li>
	<li>Relates to other branches of math and computer science. Ex:  In writing computer programming "code", knowing the meanings of AND, OR, and IF...THEN is essential.</li> 
	<li>Logic is fun.  People enjoy reading books like Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland that use logic illustrate paradox and create humor.  People enjoy doing and thinking about puzzles.</li>
	<li>Tidbit:  Gödel: the Liar's Paradox:  A variation of the liar's paradox is illustrated by the 2 cards below. Follow your reasoning out loud with a partner and see how what is stated here leads to a paradox, i.e. contradiction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="over">Overview</h2>

<ul>
	<li>3.1  We practice translating English to symbolic form;  Also we study quantified statements.  That is statements containing the words "all" or "some" in them.</li>
	<li>3.2 and 3.3  We will look at the meanings of each of these types of statements and construct truth table summaries of their truth values (when are they true, when are they false.)</li>
   	<li>3.4  We will determine whether 2 statements are equivalent, and study variations of the "if then" conditional statement.</li>
	<li>3.5  Several statements together form arguments.  We will study what makes an argument valid.</li>
	<li>(Optional:  3.6  A look at another type of logic using Venn diagrams called Aristotelian logic.)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
As a starting point in the study of logic, specifically, Symbolic Logic, we analyze English sentences by first translating them into symbols called Symbolic Form.  We have:
Simples statements + Connectives = Compound statements;
	<ul>
		<li>simple statemts: p, q, and r</li>
		<li>connectives: not ~, and ^, or v, if then -->, if and only if <--></li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="def">Definitions:</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>statement -</dt>
	<dd>A simple statement or statement is a complete sentence expressing one idea;  It can be determined to be true or false.  (We will avoid statements of opinion.)  <br />
Ex.  George Bush is the President of the Czech Republic. Non ex:  Mary Poppins is very nice.</dd>

	<dt>connectives &ndash;</dt>
	<dd>connective type words.  The ones we are concerned with:  and, or , if&mdash;then and
if and only if ( also not)</dd>

	<dt>compound statement &ndash;</dt>
	<dd>2 or more simple statements combined together with connectives.  Also the negation of a simple statement is a compound statement. Ex.1  Mrs. Perel is not an engineer. Ex.2  Hilary Clinton is a senator and she lives in California.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
You should be familiar with the word and symbols so that you can translate between the English and the symbolic form (logical form)
