			   <a href="/html/">HTML</a> (the Hypertext
			   Markup Language) and <a href="/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> (Cascading Style Sheets) are two
			   of the core technologies for building Web
			   pages. HTML provides the <em>structure</em> of the page, CSS the
			   (visual and aural) <em>layout,</em> for a
			   variety of devices. Along with <a href="graphics">graphics</a> and <a href="script">scripting</a>, HTML and CSS
			   are the basis of building Web pages and

                        <p>
			   <a href="/html/">HTML</a> is the language
			   for describing the structure of Web
			   pages. HTML gives authors the means to:

                        <ul class="show_items">
                           <li>
			      Publish online documents with headings,
			      text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
			   </li>
                           <li>
			      Retrieve online information via

			      button.
			   </li>
                           <li>
			      Design forms for conducting transactions
			      with remote services, for use in
			      searching for information, making
			      reservations, ordering products, etc.
                           </li>
                           <li>
			      Include spread-sheets, video clips,
			      sound clips, and other applications
			      directly in their documents.
			   </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
			   With HTML, authors describe the structure
			   of pages using <em>markup.</em> The
			   <em>elements</em> of the language label
			   pieces of content such as &#x201C;paragraph,&#x201D;
			   &#x201C;list,&#x201D; &#x201C;table,&#x201D; and so on.
                        </p>



                        <h2>What is XHTML?</h2>


                        <p>
			   XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the
			   syntax of <a href="../xml/core">XML</a>,
			   the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has
			   all the same elements (for paragraphs,
			   etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntax
			   is slightly different. Because XHTML is an
			   XML application, you can use other XML
			   tools with it (such as <a href="../xml/transformation">XSLT,</a> a
			   language for transforming XML content).
                        </p>



                        <h2 id="whatcss">What is CSS?</h2>


                        <p>
			   <a href="/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> is the
			   language for describing the presentation of
			   Web pages, including colors, layout, and
			   fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation
			   to different types of devices, such as
			   large screens, small screens, or
			   printers. CSS is independent of HTML and
			   can be used with any XML-based markup
			   language. The separation of HTML from CSS
			   makes it easier to maintain sites, share
			   style sheets across pages, and tailor pages
			   to different environments. This is referred
			   to as the <em>separation of structure (or:
			   content) from presentation.</em>
                        </p>


                        <h2 id="webfonts">What is WebFonts?</h2>
				    <p>
				WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on
				demand over the Web without requiring installation in the operating system.
				W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until
				recently, downloadable fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack
				of an interoperable font format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that
				through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the Web
				(called "WOFF").
				    </p>

                        <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>


                        <p>
			   The following very simple example of a
			   portion of an HTML document illustrates how
			   to create a link within a paragraph. When
			   rendered on the screen (or by a speech
			   synthesizer), the link text will be &#x201C;final
			   report&#x201D;; when somebody activates the link,
			   the browser will retrieve the resource
			   identified by
			   &#x201C;http://www.example.com/report&#x201D;:
                        </p>

<pre>
<p class="moreinfo">For more information see the
<a href="http://www.example.com/report">final report</a></p>
</pre>

                        <p>
			   The <code>class</code> attribute on the
			   paragraph's start tag (&#x201C;&lt;p&gt;&#x201D;) can be
			   used, among other thing, to add style. For
			   instance, to italicize the text of all
			   paragraphs with a class of &#x201C;moreinfo,&#x201D; one
			   could write, in CSS:
                        </p>

<pre>p.moreinfo { font-style: italic }</pre>

                        <p>
			   By placing that rule in a separate file,
			   the style may be shared by any number of
			   HTML documents.
                        </p>
