		<td>"...the Arab people invented the decimal numbering system — the basic language of mathematics. Armed with this language, it became possible to learn the answers to more complex problems such as 100+100 without having to visualise 200 pebbles. It also gave way to pre-computed answers in the form of lookup tables — the most trivial form of computational engineering. Lookup tables such as the ones used for multiplication can instantaneously provide answers at a glance without any mental effort." A.Bawany</td>
