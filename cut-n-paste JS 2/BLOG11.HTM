<h3>NYSMATYC Conference 2009</h3>
</td>

<tr>
<td> 

<p>I decided to go with colleague Donna Malczewski to the Annual NYSMATYC conference in Albany New York, April 17-19, 2009. This was a great opportunity because not only did we get to know each other better but we decided ahead to strategize on who went to which session. As usual there will be more than one presentation that you wish you could attend yet one is offered at the same time as the other. Donna and I covered the bases. She attended the one and I the other, collecting materials and taking notes for each other. At the end of each day we shared. 
<p>
Donna came to the conference with a urgent concern. She feels that students overuse and misuse the calculator at the elementary and secondary level, before they arrive at college. So she went to the birds of a feather sessions to get some “answers”. I am not sure she resolved the issue but she was consoled in general by the revelation that many other teachers have our same concerns.

<p>
Not only do other teachers she encountered at the conference groan when students use their cell phone to calculate “3 times 1” and “5 times 6”, but teachers also struggle to make  their developmental math programs work. In trying to fix things in their developmental math program, Duchess Community College is re-designing their developmental courses. Students were arriving in their math courses yet still acting like high-school students. Even with the restructuring, they assess that there still remain some problems. Students seem to want to skim over the initial weeks of the course that involve the drill of the “basics” and yet this leaves them deficient in preparation for the next 4-5 weeks of the course that include the more meaty work. In this second set of weeks they are called on to work in collaborations with partners on hands-on activities where they delve into the concepts more deeply. The trouble spot is in the expectation that they do some pre-reading. But there is hope. The assessment shows that the students get more out of it, develop relations with their classmates. It is a positive experience for them.

<p>What else did I learn…?</p> 

<p>Jae Ki Lee (Teachers College, Columbia University) and Julia Kim presented us with the 2537 Rule. New hope for teaching fractions. (By-the-way did you know that in Korea students must have the multiplication facts memorized with speed by the 3rd grade or they will not be passed?)</p>

<p>The 2537 Rule was shown in solving the problems: “What is the GCF and LCM of 30 and 18?” So you check divisibility into both numbers by first 2, in the first step, and then by 5 in the second step and then by 3 and last by 7. In so doing you complete a nifty little table. The GCF is the numbers on the left side of the table. You multiply them together. And the LCM is the numbers in the “L” shape portion of the table. “L” as in “LCM”. Multiplied together. There is a criss-cross pattern too that helps you build the old fraction to the new fraction later on. By the way, do you know the Divisibility Rule for 7?  To determine divisibility by 7 take the number in question, and take its ones digit times 2. Subtract this result from the remaining digits to the left of its ones place. If this is divisible by 7 then the original number is! Ex. 154 = 15 – 4x2 = 15-8 = 7. Since 7 is divisible by 7, and so then so is 154 divisible by 7. Check your work with a calculator. </p>

GCF = 2*3 = 6<br />
LCM = 2*3*5*3 = 90
