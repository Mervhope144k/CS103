<p>What else I learned...</p>  

<p>Marybeth Orrange suggests some simple tips but important tips for success in the online classroom.  Model “attendance” by your being responsive to students. Swiftly respond to posts in forums, say, and to student emails. Let students know you are at a 3-day conference and will return on such and such date, instead of just “disappearing”. When they point out typos in your posted material, fix them immediately. Distribute clear materials by checking spelling and grammar always. Show them you are paying attention and they will reciprocate.</p>
<p>In the same panel workshop Mark Marino also suggests using engaging online Discussions Forums. He seems to have it right with the use of “probing” questions, and some interesting topics. One forum focuses on students’ examples of real-world math errors, found in articles, and media. Also as test review, Mark constructs a Discussion Forum with about 50 math problems, each its own post. Students select, on a first come first serve basis, 5 problems (posts) to complete (reply to). They reply to each problem post with a solution (and comments). This meets the goal of reviewing as well allowing the students to talk math and interact. Careful discussion thread management is key.</p>
 
<p>Inspiring Math educators through film.  “How to entice students to do better.” Andrea Blum initiated “Movie Nights” with her math faculty members at Suffolk Community College. The incentive for faculty? See what so and so’s house looks like! Nonetheless the experience was one that the members appreciated. They watched "N is a Number:  A Portrait of Paul Erdos" and "Stand and Deliver", docudrama about LA teacher Jaime Escalante and his students. The stories they watched provided a springboard. It led to a sharing about teaching and about mathematical accomplishments of their own students and of their own. They recognized that what Jaime Escalante did was what we do when we experience success. And that is when we have a concern for the students we teach and are dedicated. And when we but especially the student understands the necessity of time commitment and persistence in their work and follows through in that vane.
