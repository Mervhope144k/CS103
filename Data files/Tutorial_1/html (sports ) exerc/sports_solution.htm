When the Oakland Coliseum opened in 1966, it was hailed as a Brutalist gem that could house two sports in an elegantly simple, circular design. (The It was constructed as part of a wave of multipurpose stadiums designed to house both football and baseball teams.)
</p>

<p>
A half-century later, it is perhaps America's most hated sports stadium. Players and coaches deride it. The Oakland Raiders are fleeing it. The lights are breaking, mice are dying in the soda machines, and the sewage that sometimes floods the dugouts has its own Twitter account.
</p>

<p>
Even these pages have called it "a bland, charmless concrete monstrosity" that "isn't worthy of preservation."
</p>

<p>
Now, after more than a decade of searching, the Oakland Athletics are forging ahead on an exit plan to escape to a gleaming new waterfront ballpark, complete with a gondola to ferry fans to and from the nearby transit station. The stadium would be the latest in a 30-year wave of major league ballparks that saw 24 of the league's 30 teams move into new homes. Most have been intimate, downtown stadiums that mix retro aesthetics with modern comforts, like leather recliners, beer gardens and a swimming pool.

But does baseball need another retro-modern downtown ballpark? What does the sport and Oakland lose by demolishing the Coliseum?
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Coliseum is ugly, but it is cheap, gritty and fun. The spacious confines allow fans to roam around, spread out and enjoy a comprehensive view of the game. And the park's dinginess fosters a freewheeling atmosphere, where bleacher die-hards bang drums and heckle outfielders, while upper-deck denizens pack picnics and pass joints.
