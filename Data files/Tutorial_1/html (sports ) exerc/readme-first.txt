Follow this order:
1. Open the webpage called html_css_videos.htm and watch the first two video about HTML.

2. Complete the exercise (pdf file) called "html_(sports)_exerc_v1.pdf" 

3. The file "how-to-get-file-extensions-to-show" is something you may be interested in. It is useful to know for the following situation. You try to rename a text file in Windows File Explorer, with the extension of .html instead of .txt. In renaming it, if the file extensions are not showing you may end up with an incorrect file extension. Suppose your text file was called mywebpage. Without the extensions showing, you might end up renaming it as mywebpage.html.txt instead of what you had intended, mywebpage.html.
