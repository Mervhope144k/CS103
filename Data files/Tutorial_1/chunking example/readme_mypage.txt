Chunking -- 
     Linking from one part of the page to another part of the same page ... 

Chunking but here another twist is added: 
     Linking from one part of a page one page to a SECOND page AND to a specific location in that SECOND page.

The file myPage.html links to examplePage.htm, but to a specfic spot on the examplePage.htm, where the "What is WebFonts?" <h2> tag is.

Study the code of the mypage.html file.
